# Project management on GitHub

The goal of this meetup is to show how to manage projects with GitHub.

**Who is the audience?**

Anyone who needs to manage a project, particularly if some aspect of it
involves GitHub, including analysts, developers, and project managers.

**Why is this important?**

Most projects involving code use GitHub to kick off an idea, start a
conversation, write some code, and track progress. You may manage
projects with complex tools elsewhere, but GitHub now has great features
for that. Why not **K**eep **I**t **S**uper **S**imple?

**Objectives**

-   Manage a project from the perspective of a project manager.
-   Manage a project from the perspective of an analyst / developer.
-   Watch updates and track linked work.

## As a project manager

-   On a GitHub organization, create a project table

Backlog:

-   Add work items from the [existing repositories litCode and
    litData](https://github.com/orgs/an-org/repositories?q=lit&type=all&language=&sort=).
-   Add draft issue “Polish docs”, set the assignees.
-   Switch views, and modify metadata by dragging the draft issue to
    “todo”.
-   Rename the view to “Backlog” and save the changes.

Mauro’s progress:

-   Add the hidden field milestone and linked pull requests.
-   Create a new field “Iteration”.
-   Group by milestone, and filter by assignees
-   Save as a new view.

Add missing metadata:

-   Set the status and milestone for future work items.

## As an analyst / developer

-   Create an issue from the draft, change the status to “In progress”.
-   Merge a pull-request that closes an issue.

## Watch updates and track linked work

-   Notice the status has automatically updated, and everything is
    linked.

## Takeaways

-   GitHub projects are user friendly, even if you don’t write code.
-   If some work is on GitHub anyway, it makes sense to manage the
    project there.
-   Project views update automatically, and everything stays linked.

## Resources

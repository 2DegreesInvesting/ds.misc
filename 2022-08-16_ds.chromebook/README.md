## Data science on a chromebook

The goal of this meetup is to show that you can work from a cheap
chromebook.

It’s inspired by the post [Data Science on a
Chromebook](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2017-08-29-data-science-on-a-chromebook/)
(Jeff Leek, 2017) and by my urgent need for a computer when my main one
broke down.

**Who is the audience?**

Data scientists, including analysts and software developers.

**Why is this important?**

This meetup is particularly useful when you can’t access a powerful
computer. It can save you money, or help you recover from a computer
catastrophe.

**Objectives**

-   Overview of my chromebook.
-   Use an online computer with “unlimited” resources.
-   Use an offline computer with limited resources.

## Overview of my chromebook

-   Cost: USD 120.
-   Resources: 2 cores, 4GB memory, 64GB storage.
-   ChromeOS:
    -   Few apps.
    -   Lean keyboard (e.g. lacks CAPS lock, right-click, del)
        ([simulator](https://partnerdash.google.com/apps/simulator/chromebook#get-to-know-your-keyboard?l=en)).
    -   Files: Local (MyFiles) and remote (Google Drive).

## Use an online computer with “unlimited” resources

-   Example computer running RStudio on the cloud.
-   [How to setup a computer on the

-   [How to scale your computing resources up and
    down](https://youtu.be/NF7HPKt55Yk).

## Use an offline computer with limited resources

-   [Setup a Linux development
    environment](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux/setup).
-   [Sharing files to
    Linux](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux/setup#sharing-files-to-linux).
-   [Install Docker engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
-   Setup Git and GitHub, e.g with `gh`
    ([install](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-raspberry-pi-os-apt)).

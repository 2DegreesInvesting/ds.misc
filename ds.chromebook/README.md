## Data science on a chromebook

The goal of this meetup is to show that you can work from a cheap
chromebook.

It’s inspired by the post [Data Science on a
Chromebook](https://simplystatistics.org/posts/2017-08-29-data-science-on-a-chromebook/)
(Jeff Leek, 2017) and by my urgent need for a computer when my main one
broke down.

## Who is the audience?

Data scientists, including analysts and software developers.

## Why is this important?

This meetup is particularly useful when you can’t access a powerful
computer. It can save you money, or help you recover from a computer
catastrophe.
